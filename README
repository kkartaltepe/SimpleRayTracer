This is just a simple ray tracer built for fun, and to learn a bit about pthreads
and brush up on C/C++ basics. Maybe later fiddle with OpenGL some more.

Current Features:
 - Geometry
  * Triangles
  * Circles
 - Point Lights
 - Shadows
 - Diffuse Lighting
 - FoV Camera
 - Bounding Volume Heirarchy acceleration (utilizing Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes and Z-Ordering of primitives)
